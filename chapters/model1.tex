The first approach makes the assumption that GSN's learn complex feature transformations that represent the most information-bearing aspects of the input. Therefore, the recurrent step should be less complicated (through a single regression step). This model uses both artificial time-sequencing (for the GSN training to have BPTT), as well as real time-sequencing (for regression step).
