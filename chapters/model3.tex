Both the EM and online learning methods for training the recurrent deep GSN have their drawbacks - EM only models the sequence linearly in the latent variable \(H\) space while the online learning method requires untied weights between layers. This model, the hybrid approach, aims to combine the best of both worlds by creating an alternating structure inspired by convolutional neural networks with alternating convolutional and pooling layers \cite{lenet5}.
